/*
Why we did this new change.

If we invoke a function like getSmartPhone. We will be able to only get that SmartPhone dependency.
If we wanted get another dependency we would have to create another function in the component interface and invoked it here.
But, now we donâ€™t need to create a specific function for each and every dependency. Instead we can get those dependencies to the MainActivity using field injection.
 as an example if we want ot inject the sim card the only thing that we need is doing this
 @Inject
    lateinit var simCard: SIMCard
 */
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    @Inject
    lateinit var smartPhone: SmartPhone


    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
/*
Since at least one of our modules has a state, we cannot use this simple create function, to construct a SmartPhoneComponent.
Instead we have to use the builder.
 */
//        DaggerSmartPhoneComponent.create()
//            .inject(this)
//        smartPhone.makeACallWithRecording()
/*
When we are constructing the component with a builder function , we have to add each module with a state here
 */
 (application as SmartPhoneApplication).smartPhoneComponent.inject(this)
